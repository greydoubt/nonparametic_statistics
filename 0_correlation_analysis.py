'''In both examples, we read the CSV data into a DataFrame (or data frame in R), calculate the correlation matrix using the corr function, and obtain the absolute correlation values for each variable pair. We then filter for pairs with correlation values above a certain threshold (in this case, > 0.7 and < 1.0) and sort the pairs based on the correlation strength.

The output will provide you with the strongly correlated variable pairs, along with their correlation coefficients. By examining these pairs, you can identify the most interesting variables that exhibit strong correlations.'''
