# Machine Learning Algorithms Examples

This repository provides code examples of various machine learning algorithms implemented in Python and R. The examples cover a range of tasks such as classification, regression, hypothesis testing, and more. Whether you are an R or Python programmer, this collection offers practical implementations for both languages.

## Algorithms

The repository includes examples for the following machine learning algorithms:

1. Mann-Whitney U test:
   - Python: `mann_whitney_u_test.py`
   - R: `mann_whitney_u_test.R`

2. Kruskal-Wallis test:
   - Python: `kruskal_wallis_test.py`
   - R: `kruskal_wallis_test.R`

3. Spearman's rank correlation:
   - Python: `spearman_rank_correlation.py`
   - R: `spearman_rank_correlation.R`

4. Kendall's rank correlation:
   - Python: `kendall_rank_correlation.py`
   - R: `kendall_rank_correlation.R`

5. Wilcoxon signed-rank test:
   - Python: `wilcoxon_signed_rank_test.py`
   - R: `wilcoxon_signed_rank_test.R`

6. Friedman test:
   - Python: `friedman_test.py`
   - R: `friedman_test.R`

7. Chi-squared test:
   - Python: `chi_squared_test.py`
   - R: `chi_squared_test.R`

8. Bootstrapping:
   - Python: `bootstrapping.py`
   - R: `bootstrapping.R`

9. XGBoost (Classification):
   - Python: `xgboost_classification.py`
   - R: `xgboost_classification.R`

The code examples provide a practical implementation of each algorithm using sample datasets or simulated data. You can explore each file for detailed code and instructions on running the algorithms.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/machine-learning-algorithms-examples.git
```

2. Navigate to the desired algorithm folder (e.g., `kruskal_wallis_test.py` for the Kruskal-Wallis test in Python or `kruskal_wallis_test.R` for R).

3. Open and run the file using your preferred development environment or command line.

4. Modify the code and datasets as needed to fit your specific use case. Each example file contains comments to guide you through the necessary modifications.
